This repository collects the code for the project that Alessandro Pedrani and Matteo Rossi have done for the course Statistical Machine Learning (MAT0043) at the University of Turin, under the guidance of Prof. Silvia Montagna.##
### Guidelines on the use of the files:
1) **1 - Features_Extraction.ipynb** is the notebook contating the code to extract MFCCs with different number of coefficients and different sampling rates and storing then in a (huge) .txt file.
2) **2 - Visualization.ipynb** contains some visual exploratory analysis on the data.
3) **3 - Classification at Frame-Level using KNN.ipynb**, **4 - Classification using GMM.ipynb**, **5 - Classification using GMM+frame selection.ipynb** and **6 - Classification using a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture.ipynb** are the files for the splitting the datases and running our models and their extensions
